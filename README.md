# IR From Bag-of-words to BERT and Beyond through Practical Experiments

This is the official of the "**IR From Bag-of-words to BERT and Beyond through Practical Experiments**", an [ECIR 2021](https://www.ecir2021.eu) full-day tutorial with [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) and [OpenNIR](https://opennir.net) search toolkits.

# About the tutorial

Advances from the natural language processing community have recently sparked a renaissance in the task of adhoc search. Particularly, large contextualized language modeling techniques, such as [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)), have equipped ranking models with a far deeper understanding of language than the capabilities of previous bag-of-words ([BoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)) models. Applying these techniques to a new task is tricky, requiring knowledge of deep learning frameworks, and significant scripting and data munging. In this full-day tutorial, we build up from foundational retrieval principles to the latest neural ranking techniques. We provide background on classical (e.g., [BoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)), modern (e.g., [Learning to Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank)) and contemporary (e.g., [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) search ranking and re-ranking techniques. Going further, we detail and demonstrate how these can be easily experimentally applied to new search tasks in a new declarative style of conducting experiments exemplified by the [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) and [OpenNIR](https://opennir.net) search toolkits.

This tutorial is interactive in nature for participants; it is broken into sessions, each of which mixes explanatory presentation with hands-on activities using prepared Jupyter notebooks running on the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform.

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be comfortable accessing classical inverted index data structures, building declarative retrieval pipelines, and conducting experiments using state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
